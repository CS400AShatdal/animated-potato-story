	"Milk, flour, eggs, sourdough," "milk, flour, eggs, sourdough" Nathan kept repeating to himself. In hindsight he really should have just written the items down so he wouldn't have to keep worrying about forgetting one. But no, Nathan had run out of the door without a list, so now he was reduced to murmuring the list of items on repeat like a child trying to memorize vocabuary. Sadly, there was no other choice for Nathan, lest he risk forgetting one item prior to completing his task, so he kept to his murmuring as he rode down the freeway towards the Trader Joes that awaited him.
